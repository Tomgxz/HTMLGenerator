Problem clearly identified and the features described justified and linked to a clear explanation of its amenability to computational approaches. 
Stakeholders are described and choice of them fully explained both in terms of their possible use of the solution and there usefulness in supporting the development of it. 
Similarly there is detailed analysis of other competing solutions which considers usability and algometric approaches taken in their production. 
This includes consideration of features that go beyond the scope of the proposed solution .. with some reasons. 
Tom links this research to his own intended solutions. 
He then uses this research to identify and fully explain the features of his solution, he is less specific about limitations aside from those already mentioned in the research. 
Hardware, software and scalability requirements are considered and justified; a more specific minimum specification and/or links between this and scalability would be nice. 
Success criteria are extensive, measurable and justified. 
On balance sufficient for top mark.
